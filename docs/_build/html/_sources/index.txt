Welcome to WoPMaRS's documentation!
===================================

**WoPMaRS** is a workflow manager written in Python which aims to ease the *reproducibility* of the results obtained during an analysis workflow. This reproducibility is ensured by the support of a SQLite database containing the results obtained during the workflow. An other advantage of using a relational database is to let you use the constraints enforced by the Database Management System to guarantee consistent and easily manipulable results.
