Introduction
============

The connection between the results of a tool and their insertion into the database is done thanks to Python classes called *wrappers* compatible with WoPMaRS. These wrapper classes are able to both wrap the execution command line of an analysis tool and perform *pre* or *post* data processing (like, for example, gather data from the database or insert them).

Here comes two use-cases which are:

- **develop** wrapper classes also called *ToolWrappers*
- **use** these *ToolWrappers* to perform an analysis workflow
